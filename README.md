I’m a Computer Science Master’s student at NIT Calicut, exploring the intersection of system internals, deep learning research, and advanced algorithms. I previously worked as a Software Engineer at [`Rappit`](https://rappit.io/), where I contributed to building robust frontend interfaces, optimizing document extraction workflows, developing custom machine learning models, and designing scalable cloud-based test pipelines. I also interned at ISRO, where I worked on technologies related to handling large-scale data infrastructure and processing pipelines.

Currently, my work focuses on deepfake detection using physiological signals, where I’m investigating on various facial features that adapt to individual variability as step toward more reliable and explainable AI forensics. Beyond academics, I’m actively building developer tools like [`line-watch`](https://github.com/SREEHARI-M-S/line-watch), a custom `grep`-like CLI utility with regex support, designed to be fast, intuitive, and easy to use.

I’m passionate about learning the engineering behind real-world systems and regularly share insights from my projects and research through my [website](https://sreehari-m-s.netlify.app/). I love collaborating on impactful ideas — let’s connect!
